# Emergency Card

Use this when you need forget to say happy birthday, merry xmas, etc to that special some one

At the moment Emergency Card only has four holidays which include 
1. Birthdays
2. Xmas
3. New Years
4. Halloween

Why only four? Cuz I got lazy. But in the near future there will have many more holidays!

Why does it look crappy on my phone but good on my computer? You may ask, well I once again got lazy. And will add responsivity in the near future. 

Okay but how does it work? Simple, just fill out the form, the form will then do some magic and you'll be redirected to your e-card(emergency card) from there you can copy the link from the search bar and send it to that speical someone! [Here's]() the link to get started!

P.S. This idea was inspired by JacksFilms, "Make a dang valentine"
